## Verifying Scope
- [BGP Website](https://bgp.he.net/) provides you who owns this subnet

## Vulnerability Scanning
- Using Nessus scan and have this scheduled


## Attacking Login Portals

- [TREVORspray](https://github.com/blacklanternsecurity/TREVORspray) -> Can be used for Password spraying on O365
  - For this you should use multiple machines -> Here you could for example spin up a few machines in Azure or AWS (Automation with Terraform would be nice for that)
- OWA (Outlook Web Access) -> If a company has hosting of outlook web app on own side
  - Metasploit usefull to attack this one! -> Scanner
- Attacking Othe Portals
  - Burpsuite makes sense here
